Opening 1 - Monster Speech, basically a death note rip off
There are many types of monsters in this world.                       
monsters who always exude their confidence - make themselves known,
monsters who cause needless violence - all for the attention,
monsters who\t just can't shut up...                                        
and monsters who always tell lies.

Lying monsters are a real nuisance. 
They lie about their interests.
They lie to their friends, their family, their loves ones.
And worst of all\t they lie to themselves.

If I were to encounter such monsters,
I'd likely be eaten by it.\t
Because in truth,

I am that monster.
